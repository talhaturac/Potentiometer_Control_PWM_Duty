## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

I am actively working on development kits from Texas Instruments and developing embedded software. In this post here, I wanted to share one of the projects I have done so that you can benefit from it. Enjoy!

Why are we here:

* To create projects from Code Composer Studio IDE.
* To be able to use the ADC unit, read and use this data.
* To generate and configure PWM signals.
* To be able to set the duty cycle ratio and other parameters of the PWM signal.

You can experiment by customizing the project code to your own TI development board. Or you can use the information shared here to create your own customizations that use the ADC unit and ePWM unit. The actual code is in the main.c file.

## Built With

It was built using the C programming language, via Code Composer Studio IDE, with the LAUNCHXL-F280025C (C2000 MCUs family) development kit from Texas Instruments.
             

* [Code Composer Studio IDE -> version 11.0.0.00012](https://www.ti.com/tool/download/CCSTUDIO/11.0.0.00012)
* [C2000Ware Library -> version 4.00.00.00](https://www.ti.com/tool/download/C2000WARE/4.00.00.00)
* [F280025C LaunchPad™ development kit for C2000™ real-time MCU](https://www.ti.com/tool/LAUNCHXL-F280025C)
